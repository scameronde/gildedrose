# gildedrose
My take on the gilded rose kata. 

The focus was on refactoring using automated transformations from within IntelliJ as much as possible. I wanted to show
that you can achieve a good compromise if you do not rewrite the logic but refactor it using baby steps and let the design
evolve naturally.
